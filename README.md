### Overview
Javascript program written in P5 that follows a choose your own adventure approach in introducing a new Speculative technology to the user. The user makes decisions on what to do with this technology and at the end are given a score based on their performance on how well they handled the tech. 

### Technical Details
States are manipulated using the p5.play class. There is no collision, but there is frequent state changes made by the user. Strong use of the clickable class. Uses of an interactive table, a clickable layout table, and finally a adventure states manager.
